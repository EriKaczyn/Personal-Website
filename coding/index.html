                    In my Video Game Design class, I worked with a team to create this puzzle adventure game using Unity and C#. We worked together to design the game mechanics, puzzles, and story. The player adopts the role of a gem-person who must escape miners trying to mine their valuable gems. The player collects different gems, which each have different abilities, and adds them to the gem-person's limbs to use their abilities, like freezing water and grappling. We thought that this mechanic made the game very unique and gave the player different ways to overcome the obstacles in each level. I mostly worked on the HUD and UI and the blocking and health mechanics. Just like the other games I've worked on, it was fun to combine design, programming, and art and to think outside of the box when coming up with unique gameplay features.

                    In my Media Device Architecture class, I used C and a Game Boy Advance emulator to create this platformer game. The player takes on the role of a witch who ventures through a forest plagued by giant ants and uses magic to shrink them down to their original size. This was a fun project because I got to design, code, and make the art for the game. It was so exciting to see it go from an idea to a finished product! Like the game below, I wanted to do something different. I decided that having magic in the game is a great way to allow the player to navigate the levels in more ways than just killing the enemies. Click the title above to play the game. The online emulator indicates key bindings.

                    <p style="padding:20px">
                    In my Objects and Design class, my classmates and I used Java to create this tower defense game. In the game, big dogs are trying to steal a small dog's food, and the player has to use towers to shoo the big dogs away. This project was a great experience because I had never worked on a project of this size before and it was a great way to implement the software development lifecycle. I like turning genre cliches on their heads, so instead of the towers killing your opponents, they simply distract them (e.g. one of the towers is a catapult that throws a ball for the dogs to chase). I also did the pixel art for this game, which was fun, since I love dogs and got to imagine how different breeds would fit into the style of the game.
